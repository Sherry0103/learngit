In the Shang dynasty, whenever sacrifices were made, Shang kings would offer people to their ancestors and gods like cattle, sheep, pigs and other livestock, a system that scholars call the human animal system. The vast majority of those killed were prisoners of war and a few were slaves. The Shang kings and noble slave owners used human animals when they worshipped their ancestors, prayed to the gods for protection, built their palaces and prayed for rain, and this became a large public place for the Shang kings to worship their ancestors. A large number of sacrificial remains are buried in the shrine. Among them, 1,178 human skeletons were found in 191 ritual pits excavated in 1976. According to incomplete statistics, the oracle bones in the Yin ruins about human sacrifice of the oracle bones have 1350 pieces, divination 1992, sharing 13,052 human animals. In addition to this, after the death of the Shang king or nobility, they were also buried with human sacrifice, known as human martyrdom. The number of human martyrs, depending on the status of the tomb owner, can be as little as one, or as much as more than 200. Like the M1001 tomb, there were as many as 225 martyrs.
